This script is *slow*.\r\n\r\n###makeccrlist\r\nMakes a list of installed packages not in the main repos.\r\n\r\n###makepackagelist\r\nMakes a list of installed packages that exist in the main repos.\r\n\r\n###pacman-size-list\r\nPrints a list of installed packages in the format `XYZ.ABCKiB\tpackagename`. This script was meant to be piped through sort, like `pacman-size-list | sort -n`, in order to find the packages taking up the most space on the system. It is rather slow.\r\n\r\n###pacstats\r\nPrints a list of installed packages by repo, and some simple statistics.\r\n\r\n###update-bundle-links and remove-bundle-links\r\nThe first creates links for bundles based on name (eg, firefox-11.0-1 becomes firefox); the second removes all files created by the first. These scripts were created to get over the inconvenience of having all the bundle shortcuts that are pinned to a taskbar break every time the bundle is updated, among other things.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
